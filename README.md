# New Earth

There will always be an emphasis on putting **THE BIBLE FIRST**, but a huge problem for me and many others who walked away from faith was not having a proper church or group of people that truly broke down what it meant to be Christian in a modern world. Much of what I disliked about Christianity was actually **CARNAL CHRISTIANITY**. Eventually if you want truth you'll find it; there are plenty of resources online that can help you understand exactly how to grow in faith and/or operate in the world as someone with faith.

Everything will always be downstream from the Bible, but the world is often incompatible with the true nature of Christ's teachings. Theres only a small amount of Christians who truly follow the Bible, and even fewer who have an applied perspective on how a Christ centered society could operate. After realizing how much I still do not understand, I wanted a hub where both experienced Christians and new Christians could organize and explore different aspects of modern life through a True Christian lens. The main focus is having other people with a Christian perspective give insight into both spiritual and material concerns.
