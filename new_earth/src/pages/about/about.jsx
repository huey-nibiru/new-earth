          There will always be an emphasis on putting{" "}
          <strong>THE BIBLE FIRST</strong>, but a huge problem for me and many
          others who walked away from faith was not having a proper church or
          group of people that truly broke down what it meant to be Christian in
          a modern world. Much of what I disliked about Christianity was
          actually <strong>CARNAL CHRISTIANITY</strong>. Eventually if you want
          truth you'll find it; there are plenty of resources online that can
          help you understand exactly how to grow in faith and/or operate in the
          world as someone with faith.

          Everything will always be downstream from the Bible, but the world is
          often incompatible with the true nature of Christ's teachings. Theres
          only a small amount of Christians who truly follow the Bible, and even
          fewer who have an applied perspective on how a Christ centered society
          could operate. After realizing how much I still do not understand, I
          wanted a hub where both experienced Christians and new Christians
          could organize and explore different aspects of modern life through a
          True Christian lens. The main focus is having other people with a
          Christian perspective give insight into both spiritual and material
          concerns. Whether you're Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, or even a
          NonChristian who is for the first time interested in learning the True
          path of our Lord Jesus Christ, you're welcome here.

          New Earth is a centralized hub for exploring Christian thought across
          12 key life domains. The navigation hub featuring a central gold cross
          icon surrounded by 12 navigation points represents a different aspect
          of life. A click on the central cross will route you to the Bible.
